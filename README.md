# gx2sploit

My implementation of the gx2sploit, can easily be improved by removing the OSScreen stuff! It was mostly used for debugging.

Credits:

"wiiudev" team for the original exploit.
Maschell and jam1garner for some help

# Build

Install devkitPro and devkitPPC then run "make" in a command prompt to start building.

# How does it work ?

(This explains the kernel integer overflow part of the exploit not the usage of PM4 packets)
(I should completely rewrite it because of this implementation)
